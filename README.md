# WI22-Assignment2
Design, test, and build a BufferManager, and String class that uses the BufferManager.

#### DEADLINE HERE

## Introduction

This assignment has five parts:

1. First, you're going to implement your own version of a `Buffer Manager` class. 
2. Second, you're going to implement tests to ensure that your class works correctly -- then check it into git. 
3. Third, you're going to implement your own version of a `String` class that uses your `Buffer Manager` class.
4. Fourth, you're going to implement tests to ensure that your class works correctly -- then check it into git.
5. The last part of this assignment is a "code review" -- where each student will code-review another student's work.

## Welcome to JobCo!!

You've just started a new internship at JobCo, a chic software company in the heart of Silicon Valley that sells party
balloons with integrated block-chain tracking. You've met your new manager, Chloe, who introduces you to the rest of the 
team. As you are wisked through the office, you race past a herd of zombies that are wandering aimlessly in the break room. 
"Oh my goodness", you say, in disbelief.  "Don't let them bother you", Chloe says smiling, "that's just the marketing 
department taking a lunch break". JobCo is going to be very interesting.

### Your FIRST Sprint Meeting

The next morning you get to sit in on your very first "Sprint Meeting" where the team discusses the work they're going 
to accomplish for the week. Each of the engineers talks briefly about their challenges and expected output. At last, all 
eyes drop onto you. Before panic seizes you, Chloes says, "Hey everyone, this is our new summer intern!". The team smiles 
knowingly, fully expecting you to soon become lunch for the Marketing department.  What happens next is mostly a blur. 
For one, you don't remember actually saying anything. But suddenly you realize that Chloe has tasked you with delivering 
some mission critical code, and FAST!  

### Your Team Makes a Decision

Just before the end of the standup meeting, Morris (a performance engineer) raises the topic of how slowly the application 
is performing. "Seriously", he says, "the app is running 5x slower today than it was a month ago". "What we need", he continues, 
"is someone to rewrite our string class to stop all the unnecessary memory allocations and performance problems."

Never one to miss an opportunity, Chloe exclaimed, "Great -- our new intern can build us a new string class this Sprint!". 
Sade, a Rady School student and UX designer on the team, says, "Hold on, why can't we just use the std::string class provided 
by the STL? Won't that be cheaper than building our own?"  Morris can barely contain himeself. "No!", he chides, "the STL 
is great in general, but it's way too big, and I just know we can build something smaller and faster!"

Sadly, no amount of arguing about re-inventing the wheel (or adhering to the DRY principle) would stop Morris and Chloe 
from building their own string class. Welcome to Silicon Valley. :)

String classes provide an object-oriented solution to managing character buffers in an application. Most modern applications 
have to manage strings to some degree, but for some applications, like word-processors and browsers, string management can 
have a tremendous impact on performance and memory management.


## Assignment Details

In this assignment, you are first going to build a `Buffer Manager` class. This class will be used to manage
memory allocations and deallocations.  Then, you're going to build a `String` class that uses your `Buffer Manager` class.
Finally, you're going to write tests for both classes, and then do a code review of another student's work.

Buffer Manager class should be able to allocate memory, keep track of its size, expand and contract the size of the buffer,
and free the memory when it is no longer needed. The `String` class should be able to store a string of characters, using
the `Buffer Manager` class to manage the memory.  The `String` class should also be able to append characters to the end,
handle modification of the characters, support relation operators, and have a find method.

In this assignment, you should build the string class using an "aspect-oriented" design technique.  Instead of building 
one (large) class, you're should assemble your `String` class from several smaller, "special-purpose" classes, 
like `BufferManager'.  You might make other little helper classes for other features.

> NOTE: You may not use the `std::string` class (or derivatives) to build your `String` class.  You can use `std::string` 
> as a tool to help you do testing, like we do in the autograder.  You may use library functions, like `std::strcpy`, 
> `std::memcpy`, `std::strlen`. and so forth.

### Part 1. -- Build your BufferManager<> template class

The `BufferManager` template class will be used in your upcoming `String` class assignment.  Since this class is a template,
the entire implementation will exist inside the BufferManager.hpp file. There is no BufferManager.cpp file.  

> Prior experience says that if you get this right, most of the rest of the assignment is relatively easy. 
> If you get this wrong, most of the rest of your implementation will not work.

The job of this class is to allocate, manage, and (eventually) delete the underlying heap-buffer that any class that 
inherits from this class uses to hold information of a specific data type. In particular, this class will:

1. Allocate a heap memory buffer to contain your string data (chars)
2. Guarantee that the character buffer is always terminated with a null
3. Always tracks the current length of the string
4. Automatically and correctly grow/shrink the heap-buffer when your user changes the string 
5. Automatically delete the underlying heap-buffer when the `String` object is destroyed. Consider using `std::unique_ptr<>`. 

The BufferManager class wants to be as efficient as possible. As the user changes the string, this class should 
grow/shrink the underlying buffer in the most time/space efficient way as possible.  We discussed this challenge in 
lecture, so refer to our discussion on this topic.

The overall performance the `BufferManager` class achieves will impact your grade.  So think about time/space efficiency. 
It's not hard if you're paying attention to when and how you allocate/reallocate/copy your internal buffer. 

In your starter project, you'll see we already created a (mostly) empty `BufferManager<>` class. You'll notice that the 
`BufferManager` class have a very thin interface. You're free to expand and extend it -- but you must keep the basic 
methods we've provided. 

``` cpp
    //basic buffer manager methods...
    size_t getCapacity() const; //tells us the current capacity 
    T*     getBuffer() const;   //returns ptr to internal buffer
  
    //Ask to grow buffer to aNewSize; (optional anOffset says where growth may happen)
    size_t willExpand(size_t aNewSize, size_t anOffset=0);   
    size_t willCompact(size_t aNewSize, size_t anOffset=0); //Ask to shrink the buffer to aNewSize 
```

Here are the use-case scenarios you need to be able to handle:

#### Scenario 1 -- Construction

When someone makes a new `String`, it is empty by default. Empty strings should occupy no space. Typically, the buffer 
pointer that the `BufferManager` uses to manage the buffer is null at this point.  

``` cpp
String theString; //an empty string with length 0
```

#### Scenario 2 -- Assignment/Copy construction

It is possible to create a `String` class, and give it a non-null initializer value in the constructor:

``` cpp
String theString("hello world"); //this string requires buffer memory right from the start
```

In this scenario, the `BufferManager` needs to pre-allocate space on the heap for the buffer that will hold the contents 
of the `String`. Again, since time/space efficiency is important, you should think carefully about how large your buffer 
should be. 

1. Should it be exactly as large as the initialize string (+1 for the null terminator?)
2. Should be somewhat larger, so the string could grow "a little" without having to resize your buffer

> We refer to these choices as, "policy decisions". It is possible to write our code so that policies can be determined 
> using class composition. This allows our user to influence how our class should behave (thus, policy).

#### Scenario 3 -- Mutating (add/insert/delete) some/all of your string

In this scenario, the user is using part of the mutatation API to add/delete/insert characters into an existing string. 
This can change the size requirements of the underlying buffer. 

``` cpp
String theString("hello world"); //string length is 11 (+1 for null terminator)
theString.append(" it's a really fine day in San Diego!"); //we just added nearly 40 characters to the string; resize buffer?
```

It's likely that your buffer will need to be resized at this point. We discussed the implications of that process in 
lecture. If the length of your current buffer + the length of the appended string is more than your current buffer can 
hold, you'll do something like this:

1. allocate a new buffer, big enough to hold original string + new string + null terminator
2. copy the contents of the old buffer to the new buffer
3. copy the content being "appended" to the end of the new buffer
4. delete the original buffer
5. set your internal buffer pointer to your buffer

> NOTE: The need to expand/grow your buffer can happen in a few ways. Someone might want to "append" characters to a 
> `String`, which will cause the buffer to grow, and new characters appended. A different behavior might occur if someone 
> tries to "insert" characters into an existing string. While the buffer may still expand, the underlying data in the buffer 
> may be _logically_ split. Characters before the insertion point will remain unchanged. New characters will be inserted at 
> the insertion point. And finally, characters after the insertion point may be shifted to the right.  A similar set of 
> operations may occur if someone chooses to delete a span of characters in the middle of a `String`.  How can your 
> `BufferManager` make these operations easier for the `String` class?

### Part 2. -- Testing your Buffer Manager class implementation 

See? Building a basic buffer manager class isn't all that hard. But making it run fast, and ensuring that uses memory 
efficiently takes considerably more effort. Finding the right balance between memory usage and performance can be a 
challenge.  In order to test your memory utilization and performance, you must write your own tests. 



> It is up to you to fully implement the tests for the `Buffer Manager` class. We have provided a copy of the simple, 
> `Testable` class for this purpose. You might also consider using the excellent and widely used google testing framework (gtest). 


### Part 3. -- Build your String class
Take a look at `String.hpp`. At first glance, it looks like you have 50+ methods to implement in the `String` class. 
If you are careful and thoughtful, however, you can reuse nearly half of your methods, and you can write much less code.   
In our solution, for example, we only had to implement about 25 methods (the rest reused the ones we wrote).  
Most of our methods are fewer than 4 lines of code.  Keep in mind that your `String` class should worry about 
`String` operations, and leave buffer management to your `BufferManager` class.

Also notice that many interfaces are repeated -- once with `String`, and once with `const char*`. That's so your new 
`String` class is compatible with old-school C-strings. As you're building your code, consider how you might write your 
code so that you can handle both types with just one method.
> NOTE: Your project won't successfully build until you write basic versions of each of your methods.  The auto-tester 
> is expecting them to be available.

#### Part 3a. -- Build upon your BufferManager<> template class

The job of `BufferManager` class is to allocate, manage, and (eventually) delete the underying heap-buffer that the 
`String` class uses to hold string information (the text users assign/set/change in the string). In particular, `BufferManager` will:
1. Allocate a heap memory buffer to contain your string data (chars)
3. Always manages the buffer capacity according to a policy you set
4. Grow/shrink the heap-buffer when your user changes the string
5. Automatically delete the underlying heap-buffer when the `String` object is destroyed

> It's up to you to decide whether you make your `String` class a sub-class of `BufferManager`, or simply an owner of a 
> `BufferManager` instance (IS-A vs HAS-A). Both can be made to work.

#### Part 3b. -- Build your String class

If you're confused about what one of your `String` methods should do -- try looking up that same method on 
the std::string class provided by the C++ library. We modeled our class on theirs.  
If you're still confused, come to office hours.

##### -- The First Challenge with This Assignment is MUTABILITY

You might realize that managing the character buffer in your class can be a challenge. On the one hand, we want to make 
the code fast, so our algorithms needs to be efficient and simple. Second, we have to handle many types of changes to our 
character buffer, including:

1. handling empty strings
2. appending characters
3. inserting characters anywhere in the string
4. replacing substrings with other substrings
5. removing characters from anywhere in the string

> NOTE: Operations that mutate the a `String` might require that your underlying buffer grow/shink in size. So methods 
> that MUTATE the string will likely interact with methods you write in your `BufferManager<>` class.  
> The key here is the `BufferManager` should focus on making sure you have enough memory for the changes you want to make 
> to your string, and the `String` class should worry about manipulating data in the buffer, assuming the buffer is properly sized.


##### -- Design your code before you implement ANYTHING...

One of the most interesting aspects of a string class, is how much code gets shared and reused between different operations. 
For example, both **append** and **insert** operations cause the string to get grow.  The **replace** is a combination of 
erase and insert. There are many other such relationships.

Before your write any code, take time to think about the use-case scenarios. You can append, insert, erase, and replace, 
and each of these operations can happen on some, or just a part, of your existing string. If you take time to work through 
these scenarios, a "story" will emerge. You'll see that there are a set of *basic* operations that can be used to implement 
all the top-level string methods. Software design is all about thinking through the story of your code, and finding the 
small operations that can be combined to build larger, more complex functionality.

> NOTE: You can use the `Testable` class to write your own tests.  You can also use the google testing framework (gtest)

#### Part 3c -- Implement Relational Operators
Your next step is to add support for the relational operators (`<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=`). These operators are used to 
_compare_ strings, but also used if you want to _sort_ them.

There are 6 operators, with two versions of each (one for `String` and one for `const char*` compatibility), for a total 
of 12 methods in all.  However, if you're smart about how you write your code, you can actually implement far fewer. 
First, it's possible to implement the `char*` version, and let the `String` version call the `char*` version 
(if you're careful).  Second, it is possible to implement some of your operators in terms of others. For example: 
`X==Y` and `X!=Y` are logical opposites. That means you can implement one in terms of the other. `X!=Y` is the same as `!(X==Y)`.

Try to implement some of your relational operators in terms of the logical opposites.

#### Part 3d -- Implement the Find() Methods
In this step, you will add support for the `Find()` method, which will allow a user of your class to search within the
given string for a character, or sub-string. If found, these methods return the index position within the `String` where 
the char/substring was found, searching left-to-right.  As with the relational operators, you should be able to write 
reusable code that works for either `String` or `const char*`.

```cpp

  //return offset of target in string, or -1 to indicate "not found"
  //anOffset indicates where in your string to start searching...
  int find(const T &aTarget, size_t anOffset=0) const {
    return 0;
  }

  int find(const char *aBuffer, size_t anOffset=0) const {
    return 0;
  }
  
  int find(char aChar, size_t anOffset=0) const {
    return 0;
  }  
```



### Part 4. -- Testing your String class implementation

See? Building a basic string class isn't all that hard. But making it run fast, and ensuring that uses memory efficiently 
takes considerably more effort. Finding the right balance between memory usage and performance can be a challenge.  
In order to test your memory utilization and performance, you must write your own tests. To help you, we've added two extra 
functions in the StringTester class:

Still - no self-respecting engineer would consider the job done unless they had also provided a complete set of tests to e
nsure that the solution worked as designed. Well, we've already provided a basic testing harness for you, 
contained in the autotest file.

Make sure you test all the methods in the `String` class.

A great way to test a class is to compare against a baseline. In this case C++ provides the std::string which has the 
same kinds of methods that you are building for your `String` class. So a clever way to test, is to create two objects: 
your string, and a std::string, and do the same operations. Then compare the results. Here's an example:

``` cpp
const char* theBuffer="hello world";
ECE141::String theString(theBuffer); //initialize with theBuffer
std::string    theSTLString(theBuffer); //also intialize with theBuffer

    //now validate that we the strings are the same
if(!(theString==theSTLString.c_str())) {  //SHOULD  be valid!
  std::cout << "string init failed!\n";
  return false;
}
```

#### Speed Test

After you have your tests working, and your class is fully implemented, you can try out the speed test we provided in the `Testing` class.  You'll have to uncomment the call (and the code) in the `runSpeedTest()` function.





## Grading

Your submission will be graded along four dimensions:

``` cpp
Buffer Manager Tests
    Compile test: 10pts
    OCF test:   10pts
    Expand test:  10pts
    Compact test:  10pts
    Manual code review: 10pts

String Class Tests
    OCF Tests: 5pts
    Search Tests: 5pts
    Compare Tests: 7.5pts
    Insert Tests: 7.5pts
    Append Tests: 7.5pts
    Replace Tests: 5pts
    Erase Tests: 5pts
    Performance Tests: 2.5pts
    Coding Style: 5pts
```

In addition to passing the basic string tests (StringTest), your code will be measured for memory efficiency and performance. 
Our grading test harness will generate 1000's of strings and measure your memory usage. So make sure you test performance 
and memory efficiency carefully.

## Code Style Guide

This isn’t your first class on software or programming, and you’re probably wondering how we expect your code to be 
structured and formatted.  From the perspective of our auto-grader, structure and format are completely irrelevant. 
However, your instructors also will be viewing your code as well, so you would be wise to adhere to a few rules of thumb. 

### Format and Clarity

Your code should be formatted to be easily readable by anyone with more than 1 year of programming experience.  
Here are some guidelines for things that matter:

- Avoid dense and complicated code
- Be consistent!  Choose a coding standard for yourself and stick with it
- Partition your logic into class methods as needed to maintain clarity
- Document your code with comments that clearly indicate what you’re doing at a high level

## Submitting Your Work - Due Jan 26th at 11:30p (PST)

You’ll recall that your work is due by 11:30pm (PST).  We strongly recommend that you aim for 6p (PST) as to avoid the  
last minute mishaps that frequently occur when panic related to an impending deliverable begins, and we all tend to make silly mistakes.  

As we’ve said in lecture, you will turn your work in using GitHub. GitHub is an online code repository.  
Managing code can be very confusing, but GitHub makes the process fairly easy. And the way we’re going to handle code 
in this class is even simpler still.  More on that later.

With that said, please understand that when you submit your work via GitHub, your changes are automatically timestampde. 
Meta data in the code repository makes it plainly obvious to humans and computers alike when your submission arrived.  
This is worth mentioning, because the github timestamps on your submissions will be used to to arbitrate whether you 
turned your work in on time or not. 

Your homework will usually be auto-graded by “Vlad the Compiler” — otherwise known as our software-based auto-grader.  
Vlad can be a bit harsh when it comes to scoring homework (see the syllabus), but he does have a somewhat casual 
relationship with deadlines.  During Grad-school, Vlad often spent spring-break in Cabo-San-Lucas where he learned to 
enjoy siestas.  Most nights, Vlad awakens from his last-afternoon siesta around midnight, to begin the process of grading 
your assignments. In other words, you can generally count on a 30 minute grace period for turning in your work. We strongly 
suggest that you do not try his patience.

**NOTE**: Please don't submit object or executable files with your submissions. Only check in text files 
(source, make, student.json, and so forth).  

Please make sure that you fill out your student.json file. We need your name, PID, email and the operating system you used 
for your work. For the operating system attribute, please specify "windows", "mac" or "linux". 

``` cpp
{
  "name"  : "Your Name",
  "pid"   : "Your StudentId",
  "email" : "Your Email",
  "os"    : "windows|mac|linux",
  "effort": "# of hours you spent on this assignment",
  "course": "ece141a"
}
```

### Getting Help

You can talk with your peers about this problem. You can ask your instructors about this too. But you cannot use any 
other code for reference in solving these problems. If you're really stuck with an algorithm, join us in the programming 
dojo to get unblocked. It's really essential that you think about this challenge and work to solve it yourself.

## EXTRA Credit!

If you're feeling ambitious, you can earn extra credit if you complete this additional challenge.

### Adding support for operator+

Supporting operator+ may force you to learn a powerful new idiom in C++ on your own, before we discuss it in class.
Let's take a look at how operator+ is used:

``` cpp
const char* thePrefix = "hello";
String theSuffix(" there");
String s3 = thePrefix + theSuffix;  //invoke operator+
```

In our sample code, we are concatenating a standard C-String with an String. What makes this curious, is that C-Strings 
don't offer methods of their own. Only objects (and sometimes classes) can do that. So how does this work? The secret 
is revealed when you realize that these are not members of a class, but rather, standalone functions.

If you're up for the challenge, you can implement these methods:

``` cpp
String operator+(const String& lhs, const String& rhs);
String operator+(const String& lhs, const char* rhs);
String operator+(const char* lhs, const String& rhs);
```
